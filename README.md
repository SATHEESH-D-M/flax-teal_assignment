# Interview Shortlisting Assignment (Flax & Teal Limited)

- Name : Satheesh D M

- Roll : MA24M023

### Task :

- To develop a Initial Value Problem (IVP) solver.

- Technique : Euler's Method.
- Order of ODE : 1
- Refer to ```./task_exercise.pdf```

### ODE Solvers :

- The problem is solved in both python and rust.

- The solver is genearlised. It gets user inputs through ```config.ini``` and solves any IVP in first order by using Euler's method.

### Report :

- Refer to ```./task_report.pdf```

- This report explains my approach towards the given problem in both python and rust.
- It also contains the results of the given IVP. And comparison with analytical solution.

### Commit History :

- Refer to ```./commits.txt```

- This shows the commits made during the code development.

### Implementation :

- Refer to ```python_code/README.md``` and ```rust_code/README.md```.
